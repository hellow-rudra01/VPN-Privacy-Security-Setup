# Task 8 – VPN Setup and Connection Testing

## Objective
Understand how a VPN protects privacy by hiding IP address, encrypting online traffic, and providing secure communication.

## VPN Used
- ProtonVPN Free Version

## Steps Performed
1. Created a free account on ProtonVPN website.
2. Downloaded and installed ProtonVPN client on my laptop.
3. Logged in using my account credentials.
4. Connected to a free VPN server location: Netherlands.
5. Verified my new public IP using whatismyipaddress.com.
6. Confirmed that the VPN encrypted the internet traffic.
7. Disconnected and checked original IP address again.

## Results
| Condition | IP Address | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Without VPN | 103.29.xxx.xxx (India) | Real IP visible |
| With VPN | 185.77.xxx.xxx (Netherlands) | Hidden & encrypted |

Browser test:
- Google search worked properly
- YouTube opened slower due to encryption
- Privacy improved

## What I Learned
- VPN hides your real IP address and location
- Encrypts network traffic to protect against tracing/sniffing
- Free VPNs may have:
  - Limited speed
  - Few server locations
  - Data limits

## Conclusion
Using a VPN increases privacy and helps secure internet traffic, especially on public Wi-Fi. However, a paid VPN provides better speed and security.
